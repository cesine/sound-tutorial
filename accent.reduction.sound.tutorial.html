<p>
Instalation:
</p>
<p>
Download Audacity, a free open source sound editor.
<blockquote><p>
	Windows XP: <a href="http://cesine.ca/downloads/">audacity-win-1.2.3.exe</a><br>
	For other types of Operating systems see the Audacity website<br>
	http://audacity.sourceforge.net<p>
</blockquote>
Install
<p>
Open:
<blockquote><p>
	Save the file tunisian.soapopra5left.5.mp3 in the My Documents Folder<br>
	Open Audacity (you can probably find it in the Programs section of the Start menu.<br>
	Select File >> Open... and find tunisian.soapopra5left.5.mp3</p>
<p>
	The wave form of the file will display in a window. Click on the green triangle to listen to the file  (you can also hit the Space bar).<br>
	This is an extract from a popluar soap opera in Tunisia. The soap opera is originally from Mexico. How can you tell?<br>
	Can you guess what the speaker is saying? What do you hear?</p>
</blockquote>
View the Intonation using Pitch:
<blockquote><p>
	In the top left corner of the waveform window you can see a title that says  "tunisian.soa" and a down arrow. Click on the down arrow, select "Pitch (EAC)"<br>
</p><p>
	Play the file again. Notice the pink and white spots. These indicate the "pitch" of hte voice. Our vocal cords (actually folds of skin) vibrate like a guitar string. But unlike a guitar string our vocal folds can become tighter and looser to make different pitches. We use this when we speak. The pink and white areas indicate which pitches are strongest. Try to imagine what she would be saying in English. You can guess quite acqurately without even knowing the words or the individual sounds shes making.<br>
</p><p>
	Save the file roni.intonation.mp3 in the My Documents Folder<br>
	Open the file useing Audacity.<br>
</p><p>
	This is a recording of my little sister, Roni, when she was 5. I asked her to tell me a story. Listen to her version of a story in 15 seconds ;) Notice that her pitch falls when she finishes a thought group.<br>
</p><p>
	Save the file meera.phone.call031213.04.5.mp3 in the My Documents Folder<br>
	Open the file using Audacity.<br>
</p><p>
	This is a recording of my old roomate while she was talking to a friend on the phone in Mauritian French Creole. Listen to the file and look at the pitch. What do you find different and the same between Meera and the other speakers?<br>
